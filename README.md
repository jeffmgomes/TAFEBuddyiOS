If you want to test the application please get in touch with me, so I can provide you with the ClientID and ClientSecret to access the REST API.

After getting the ClientID and ClientSecret.
1. Rename the file *Keys-Example.plist* to *Keys.plist*. You can find this file inside the project folder.
2. Add the ClientID and ClientSecret provided to the file.
3. Run the application
